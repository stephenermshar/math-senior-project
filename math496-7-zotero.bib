  abstract = {Information networks are becoming increasingly popular to capture complex relationships across various disciplines, such as social networks, citation networks, and biological networks. The primary challenge in this domain is measuring similarity or distance between networks based on topology. However, classical graph-theoretic measures are usually local and mainly based on differences between either node or edge measurements or correlations without considering the topology of networks such as the connected components or holes. In recent years, mathematical tools and deep learning based methods have become popular to extract the topological features of networks. Persistent homology (PH) is a mathematical tool in computational topology that measures the topological features of data that persist across multiple scales with applications ranging from biological networks to social networks. In this paper, we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of using PH on complex network science. We give a brief mathematical background on PH, review different methods (i.e. filtrations) to define PH on networks and highlight different algorithms and applications where PH is used in solving network mining problems. In doing so, we develop a unified framework to describe these recent approaches and emphasize major conceptual distinctions. We conclude with directions for future work. We focus our review on recent approaches that get significant attention in the mathematics and data mining communities working on network data. We believe our summary of the analysis of PH on networks will provide important insights to researchers in applied network science.},

This paper describes several kinds of metrics on musical data, and explores the implications of these metrics in two ways: via techniques of classical topology where the metric space of all-possible musical data can be described explicitly, and via modern data-driven ideas of persistent homology which calculates the Betti-number bar-codes of individual musical works. Both analyses are able to recover three well known topological structures in music: the circle of notes (octave-reduced scalar structures), the circle of fifths, and the rhythmic repetition of timelines. Applications to a variety of musical works (for example, folk music in the form of standard MIDI files) are presented, and the bar codes show many interesting features. Examples show that individual pieces may span the complete space (in which case the classical and the data-driven analyses agree), or they may span only part of the space.},

We introduce a novel approach to matrix analysis, called clique topology, that extracts features of the data invariant under nonlinear monotone transformations. These features can be used to detect both random and geometric structure, and depend only on the relative ordering of matrix entries. We then analyzed the activity of pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampus, recorded while the animal was exploring a 2D environment, and confirmed that our method is able to detect geometric organization using only the intrinsic pattern of neural correlations. Remarkably, we found similar results during nonspatial behaviors such as wheel running and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This suggests that the geometric structure of correlations is shaped by the underlying hippocampal circuits and is not merely a consequence of position coding. We propose that clique topology is a powerful new tool for matrix analysis in biological settings, where the relationship of observed quantities to more meaningful variables is often nonlinear and unknown.},

  abstract = {Due to the nonlinearity of artificial neural networks, designing topologies for deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a challenging task and often only heuristic approach, such as trial and error, can be applied. Evolutionary algorithm can solve optimization problems where the fitness landscape is un- known. However, evolutionary algorithm is computing resource intensive, which makes it difficult for problems when deep CNNs are involved. In this paper we propose an evolutionary strategy to find better topologies for deep CNNs. Incorporating the concept of knowledge inheritance and knowledge learning, our evolution- ary algorithm can be executed with limited computing resources. We applied the proposed algorithm in finding effective topologies of deep CNNs for the image classification task using CIFAR- 10 dataset. After the evolution, we analyzed the topologies that performed well for this task. Our studies verify the techniques that have been commonly used in human designed deep CNNs. We also discovered that some of the graph properties greatly affect the system performance. We applied the guidelines learned from the evolution and designed new network topologies that outperform Residual Net with less layers on CIFAR-10, CIFAR- 100 and SVHN dataset.},

Our method achieves much better performance on the Betti number error, which directly accounts for the topological correctness.

functions and their corresponding discrete Morse\textendash{}Smale complexes, where
the geometry is defined as a smooth function sampled on the vertices of the
discrete structure. This construction required some homology computations
that turned out to be a significant improvement over existing methods
by itself. The resulting Morse\textendash{}Smale decomposition can then be efficiently
computed, and used for applications to persistence computation, Reeb graph
generation, noise removal...},

UMAP is constructed from a theoretical framework based in Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. The result is a practical scalable algorithm that applies to real world data. The UMAP algorithm is competitive with t-SNE for visualization quality, and arguably preserves more of the global structure with superior run time performance.

Moreover, we propose a methodology that involves the extraction of graphs of similarities from the text-data represented on the form of a hypergraph. The mining of informative short paths in these graphs is based on a three-step graph reduction process, and the analysis of these graphs use the degree and betweenness centralities. We conclude with an application for testing this methodology.},

  abstract = {A suitable feature representation that can both preserve the data intrinsic information and reduce data complexity and dimensionality is key to the performance of machine learning models. Deeply rooted in algebraic topology, persistent homology (PH) provides a delicate balance between data simplification and intrinsic structure characterization, and has been applied to various areas successfully. However, the combination of PH and machine learning has been hindered greatly by three challenges, namely topological representation of data, PH-based distance measurements or metrics, and PH-based feature representation. With the development of topological data analysis, progresses have been made on all these three problems, but widely scattered in different literatures. In this paper, we provide a systematical review of PH and PH-based supervised and unsupervised models from a computational perspective. Our emphasizes are the recent development of mathematical models and tools, including PH softwares and PH-based functions, feature representations, kernels, and similarity models. Essentially, this paper can work as a roadmap for the practical application of PH-based machine learning tools. Further, we consider different topological feature representations in different machine learning models, and investigate their impacts on the protein secondary structure classification.},

For drawings in particular, we cannot rely on texture, color or shad- ing information; there is little information present in a drawing beyond the spatial relationships and topology. A topological graph is an intuitive and powerful data structure and data representation framework that can capture the topological relations and spatial arrangement among entities present in images. In this paper, we use topological features automatically extracted from graph represen- tations of images for image classification. Our approach is simple, intuitive, and generic. We compare our method against a traditional feature descriptor, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) on the MNIST data set. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph approach, especially when applied to small sets of training data. In addition, our method is very fast to train, and also much less sensitive to hyperparameters, requiring little hyperparameter fine tuning.},

What can persistent homology see?

Abstract:  The usual framework for TDA takes as its starting point that a data set is sampled (noisily) from a manifold embedded in a high dimensional space, and provides a reconstruction of topological features of that manifold. However, the underlying algebraic topology can be applied to data in a much broader sense, carries much richer information about the system than just the barcodes, and can be fine-tuned so it sees only features of the data we want it to see. I will discuss this framework broadly, with focus on few of these alternative viewpoints, including applications to neuroscience and matrix factorization.

Primer: What is persistent homology?

Abstract:  A fundamental question in big data analysis is if or how these points may be sampled, noisily, from an intrinsically low-dimensional geometric shape, called a manifold, embedded in a high dimensional ``sensor'' space. Topological data analysis (TDA) aims to measure the ``intrinsic shape'' of data and identify this manifold despite noise and the likely nonlinear embedding. I will discuss the basics of the fundamental tool in TDA called persistent homology, which assigns to a point cloud a count of topological features \textendash{}roughly ``holes'' of various dimensions \textendash{} with a measure of importance of each feature recorded in a ``barcode'' of the data to help distinguish the significant features from the noise.

Venue: Webinar for DELTA (Descriptors of Energy Landscape by Topological Analysis

Abstract: This talk is an introduction to applied and computational topology, in particular as related to the study of energy landscapes arising in chemistry. We give a visual introduction to topology and homology groups. The focus of our talk is on persistent homology, which summarizes the changes in topological features across any increasing sequence of spaces. We emphasize sublevelset persistent homology, which provides a topological summary of real-valued functions, in particular energy functions. We also briefly introduce persistent homology applied to point cloud data, perhaps sampled from the low-energy conformations of a chemical system.}

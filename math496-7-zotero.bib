  abstract = {Information networks are becoming increasingly popular to capture complex relationships across various disciplines, such as social networks, citation networks, and biological networks. The primary challenge in this domain is measuring similarity or distance between networks based on topology. However, classical graph-theoretic measures are usually local and mainly based on differences between either node or edge measurements or correlations without considering the topology of networks such as the connected components or holes. In recent years, mathematical tools and deep learning based methods have become popular to extract the topological features of networks. Persistent homology (PH) is a mathematical tool in computational topology that measures the topological features of data that persist across multiple scales with applications ranging from biological networks to social networks. In this paper, we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of using PH on complex network science. We give a brief mathematical background on PH, review different methods (i.e. filtrations) to define PH on networks and highlight different algorithms and applications where PH is used in solving network mining problems. In doing so, we develop a unified framework to describe these recent approaches and emphasize major conceptual distinctions. We conclude with directions for future work. We focus our review on recent approaches that get significant attention in the mathematics and data mining communities working on network data. We believe our summary of the analysis of PH on networks will provide important insights to researchers in applied network science.},

  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Due to the nonlinearity of artificial neural networks, designing topologies for deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a challenging task and often only heuristic approach, such as trial and error, can be applied. Evolutionary algorithm can solve optimization problems where the fitness landscape is un- known. However, evolutionary algorithm is computing resource intensive, which makes it difficult for problems when deep CNNs are involved. In this paper we propose an evolutionary strategy to find better topologies for deep CNNs. Incorporating the concept of knowledge inheritance and knowledge learning, our evolution- ary algorithm can be executed with limited computing resources. We applied the proposed algorithm in finding effective topologies of deep CNNs for the image classification task using CIFAR- 10 dataset. After the evolution, we analyzed the topologies that performed well for this task. Our studies verify the techniques that have been commonly used in human designed deep CNNs. We also discovered that some of the graph properties greatly affect the system performance. We applied the guidelines learned from the evolution and designed new network topologies that outperform Residual Net with less layers on CIFAR-10, CIFAR- 100 and SVHN dataset.},

  abstract = {Segmentation algorithms are prone to make topological errors on fine-scale structures, e.g., broken connections. We propose a novel method that learns to segment with correct topology. In particular, we design a continuous-valued loss function that enforces a segmentation to have the same topology as the ground truth, i.e., having the same Betti number. The proposed topology-preserving loss function is differentiable and we incorporate it into end-to-end training of a deep neural network. Our method achieves much better performance on the Betti number error, which directly accounts for the topological correctness. It also performs superiorly on other topology-relevant metrics, e.g., the Adjusted Rand Index and the Variation of Information. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a broad spectrum of natural and biomedical datasets.},

Broadly speaking, we describe geometrical and topological properties of sliding window embeddings, as seen through the lens of persistent homology. In particular, we show that maximum persistence at the point-cloud level can be used to quantify periodicity at the signal level, prove structural and convergence theorems for the resulting persistence diagrams, and derive estimates for their dependency on window size and embedding dimension. We apply this methodology to quantifying periodicity in synthetic data sets, and compare the results with those obtained using state-of-the-art methods in gene expression analysis. We call this new method SW1PerS which stands for Sliding Windows and 1-dimensional Persistence Scoring},

  abstract = {The performance of machine learning methods is strongly depen- dent on the data representation (features) to which they are applied. For drawings in particular, we cannot rely on texture, color or shad- ing information; there is little information present in a drawing beyond the spatial relationships and topology. A topological graph is an intuitive and powerful data structure and data representation framework that can capture the topological relations and spatial arrangement among entities present in images. In this paper, we use topological features automatically extracted from graph represen- tations of images for image classification. Our approach is simple, intuitive, and generic. We compare our method against a traditional feature descriptor, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) on the MNIST data set. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph approach, especially when applied to small sets of training data. In addition, our method is very fast to train, and also much less sensitive to hyperparameters, requiring little hyperparameter fine tuning.},

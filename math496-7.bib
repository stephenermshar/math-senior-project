	Abstract = {Information networks are becoming increasingly popular to capture complex
relationships across various disciplines, such as social networks, citation networks, and
biological networks. The primary challenge in this domain is measuring similarity or
distance between networks based on topology. However, classical graph-theoretic
measures are usually local and mainly based on differences between either node or
edge measurements or correlations without considering the topology of networks
such as the connected components or holes. In recent years, mathematical tools and
deep learning based methods have become popular to extract the topological features
of networks. Persistent homology (PH) is a mathematical tool in computational
topology that measures the topological features of data that persist across multiple
scales with applications ranging from biological networks to social networks.
In this paper, we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of using
PH on complex network science. We give a brief mathematical background on PH,
review different methods (i.e. filtrations) to define PH on networks and highlight
different algorithms and applications where PH is used in solving network mining
problems. In doing so, we develop a unified framework to describe these recent
approaches and emphasize major conceptual distinctions. We conclude with
directions for future work. We focus our review on recent approaches that get
significant attention in the mathematics and data mining communities working on
network data. We believe our summary of the analysis of PH on networks will provide
important insights to researchers in applied network science.},

	Abstract = { We develop in this paper a theoretical framework for the topological study of time series data. Broadly speaking, we describe geometrical
and topological properties of sliding window embeddings, as seen through the
lens of persistent homology. In particular, we show that maximum persistence at the point-cloud level can be used to quantify periodicity at the signal
level, prove structural and convergence theorems for the resulting persistence
diagrams, and derive estimates for their dependency on window size and embedding dimension. We apply this methodology to quantifying periodicity
in synthetic data sets, and compare the results with those obtained using
state-of-the-art methods in gene expression analysis. We call this new method
SW1PerS which stands for Sliding Windows and 1-dimensional Persistence
Scoring},

	Abstract = {Recently, there's been a great deal of excitement and interest in deep neural networks because they've achieved breakthrough results in areas such as computer vision.1

However, there remain a number of concerns about them. One is that it can be quite challenging to understand what a neural network is really doing. If one trains it well, it achieves high quality results, but it is challenging to understand how it is doing so. If the network fails, it is hard to understand what went wrong.

While it is challenging to understand the behavior of deep neural networks in general, it turns out to be much easier to explore low-dimensional deep neural networks -- networks that only have a few neurons in each layer. In fact, we can create visualizations to completely understand the behavior and training of such networks. This perspective will allow us to gain deeper intuition about the behavior of neural networks and observe a connection linking neural networks to an area of mathematics called topology.

A number of interesting things follow from this, including fundamental lower-bounds on the complexity of a neural network capable of classifying certain datasets.},

	Abstract = {Due to the nonlinearity of artificial neural networks, designing topologies for deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a challenging task and often only heuristic approach, such as trial and error, can be applied. Evolutionary algorithm can solve optimization problems where the fitness landscape is un- known. However, evolutionary algorithm is computing resource intensive, which makes it difficult for problems when deep CNNs are involved. In this paper we propose an evolutionary strategy to find better topologies for deep CNNs. Incorporating the concept of knowledge inheritance and knowledge learning, our evolution- ary algorithm can be executed with limited computing resources. We applied the proposed algorithm in finding effective topologies of deep CNNs for the image classification task using CIFAR- 10 dataset. After the evolution, we analyzed the topologies that performed well for this task. Our studies verify the techniques that have been commonly used in human designed deep CNNs. We also discovered that some of the graph properties greatly affect the system performance. We applied the guidelines learned from the evolution and designed new network topologies that outperform Residual Net with less layers on CIFAR-10, CIFAR- 100 and SVHN dataset.},

	Abstract = {The performance of machine learning methods is strongly depen- dent on the data representation (features) to which they are applied. For drawings in particular, we cannot rely on texture, color or shad- ing information; there is little information present in a drawing beyond the spatial relationships and topology. A topological graph is an intuitive and powerful data structure and data representation framework that can capture the topological relations and spatial arrangement among entities present in images. In this paper, we use topological features automatically extracted from graph represen- tations of images for image classification. Our approach is simple, intuitive, and generic. We compare our method against a traditional feature descriptor, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) on the MNIST data set. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph approach, especially when applied to small sets of training data. In addition, our method is very fast to train, and also much less sensitive to hyperparameters, requiring little hyperparameter fine tuning.},
